The Data
--------------------------------------------

We took the sample data for Olympics (both summer and winter) from Tableau website. This sample data set has medals (all types) and athletes from each Olympic Games since the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia. So, the number of data set for each type of Olympics (summer and winter) is four.

We sanity checked the data for several factors including data being in metric form and our empirical contextual knowledge of Olympics.


Objective
--------------------------------------------

We set out to analyse the given data in terms of: 
• country ranking per sport
•	average age of winning a medal 

Prediction Objective: On the basis of the past trends for each country, we are going to do a prediction of the medals won by each country

We are also planning to develop an application to come-up with the same.


Contextual Knowledge
--------------------------------------------

Process
--------------------------------------------

We first checked the raw attributes to do a dimensionality reduction using clustering data into independent bunches. We have defined first factors on the basis of sports. We did the factor analysis and further characterized each of our sports in three segments as follows. Basically, we have tried to categorise the top three countries per sport. The relative size of each segment in terms of the total amount of medals won (including gold, silver and bronze) is also indicated below. In doing the analysis, we have included profiling as well as segmentation data. 


Data Validation
--------------------------------------------

We have done trend analysis to estimate the model. We have analysed trend for top three countries for each sport to further predict a data point for the next Olympics. This has been divided by the two types of Olympics. We further assessed performance on first validation data to see if 2012 figures match the predictive model that we have developed.
We reiterated the predictive model and finally were able to find a predictor which was closes to London 2012 figures.


Final Inferences
--------------------------------------------

•  Our analysis showed that since 2000,  ….. has been the best country in getting Olympic medals combined in all sports.
•	Our prediction is that in the next Olympics,  would be getting the highest number of total medals.
•	Further, by each sport, we are predicting the following table.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, prompt=FALSE, results='asis'}
table1 <- summarise(group_by(melt(ProjectData, id=c(3,6,10), measure=c(10)),Country, Sport), sum(value))
names(table1)[3] <- "Medals"
max <- aggregate(table1$Medals, list(Sport= table1$Sport), max)
names(max)[2] <- "Medals"
table1max<- merge(max,table1)
table1print<- table1max[,c(1,3)]
names(table1print)[2] <- "Top Country"
m1<-gvisTable(table1print,options=list(showRowNumber=TRUE,width=900, height=min(300,27*50),allowHTML=TRUE,page='disable'))
print(m1,'chart')
````
Now we will show which are the top countries in number of sports with the highest number of medals
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, prompt=FALSE, results='asis'}
countries <- data.frame(table(table1print[,2]))
scountries<- countries[order(-countries$Freq),]
tcountries<- scountries[which(scountries$Freq > 0),]
names(tcountries)[2]<- "number of sports"
names(tcountries)[1]<- "Country"
m2<-gvisTable(tcountries,options=list(showRowNumber=FALSE,width=500, height=min(200,27*20),allowHTML=TRUE,page='disable'))
print(m2,'chart')
```
And we can view these results in a map
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, prompt=FALSE, results='asis'}

geo <- gvisGeoChart(tcountries,locationvar="Country", 
                 colorvar="number of sports",
                 options=list(projection="kavrayskiy-vii",width=700, height=500))
print(geo)
```


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, prompt=FALSE, results='asis'}
ProjectData.m <- melt(ProjectData, id=c(6), measure=c(2))
table2 <- cast(ProjectData.m, Sport ~ variable, mean)
```

**Till then...**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, prompt=FALSE, results='asis'}


Bar <- gvisColumnChart(table2,
                    options=list(legend='none', width=1400, height=600, allowHTML=TRUE,page='disable'))
print(Bar,'chart)
